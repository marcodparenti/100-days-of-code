# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 1st, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Get familiar with GitHub, forking projects and other resources on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** My plans: take the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certification. I'm not going to be a web designer, but I need something to start with... I need to test my current abilities and the strenght of my commitments

**Link to work:** : I will take this: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/
